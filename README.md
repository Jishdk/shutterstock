Shutterstock Photo Manipulation Code

Description

Welcome to my repository where I share innovative code for photo manipulation, specifically tailored for Shutterstock images. This repository contains a collection of scripts that I've developed to enhance and transform high-quality Shutterstock photographs through various techniques such as upscaling resolution to a minimum of 4 megapixels and format conversion from PNG to JPEG. The purpose of this repository is to provide a resource for photographers, graphic designers, and hobbyists alike to explore new dimensions of photo editing that want to share their work with Shutterstock. 


Features

    PNG to JPEG Conversion: Convert your high-quality PNG images to the more widely used JPEG format without losing visual fidelity.
    Upscaling to 4MP: Employ OpenCV-powered algorithms to upscale your images to a minimum of 4 megapixels, ensuring they meet the quality standards for print and digital media.
    Batch Processing: Process multiple images in one go, saving time and maintaining a consistent standard across your image library.

How to Use

The repository is organized into separate scripts for each feature, along with a comprehensive guide on how to use them. Simply clone the repo, follow the setup instructions, and run the scripts on your photo collection.
